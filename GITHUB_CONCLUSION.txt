Project: Simple Pricer (Options, Bonds, Mini-Swap)

Conclusion:
This compact project demonstrates market-pricing fundamentals with clean, production-ready Python:
- A Black–Scholes implementation for European calls and puts (supporting dividend yield).
- A straightforward present value model for coupon bonds.
- A tiny deterministic fixed-vs-fixed swap to illustrate leg PVs and intuition about payer/receiver.

Why it matters for a portfolio:
- Shows understanding of derivatives beyond theory by building a working pricer and CLI.
- Clear tests and a Colab notebook make it easy for reviewers to run and verify.
- Leaves obvious room for extension (Greeks, implied vol, discount curves, Monte Carlo, Streamlit UI).
